<h2>Explanation of the dataset</h2>
</p>
It is crucial to understand the data foundation of the network, prior to setting up the network. 
As already mentioned the data for this study is based on the wikipidedia lists of important artists wihtin each of the five genres; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dance-pop_artists">Pop</a>, 
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hip_hop_musicians">Hiphop</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_R%26B_musicians">RnB</a>,
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_alternative_rock_artists">Rock</a>, <a href="hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_alternative_country_musicians">Country</a>.
The data has been downloaded by reading the list of artists for each genre using the wikipedia API. The result of the API is a html file containing the list of artists 
of the given genre. By using regular expression on the html files it is possible to extract and save the name of each artist into a pandas DataFrame. Hence this process
results in a dataframe containing the list of all artists with the attributes <i>name, genre, name_ and link_name</i>. 
Then it is possible to use the same wikipedia API to download the wikipedia page of every artist. 
The downloaded wikipedia pages is then saved as .txt files with the link_name of then given artist.

After the retrieval of the wikipedia pages different attributes can be collected from the .txt files, e.g. information about origin, latitude, longitude and years_active. 
Furthermore the number of followers can be retrived by using the genius API. The final dataset ready for basic statistics and network analysis consists of the following attributes.

    <td>-The genre that the artist belongs to. It is possible for an artist to be in multiple genres. In such cases this attribute will take on multiple values that are separated by comma.</td>
