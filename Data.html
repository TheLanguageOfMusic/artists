<h2>Explanation of the dataset</h2>
</p>
It is crucial to understand the data foundation of the network, prior to setting up the network. 
As already mentioned the data for this study is based on the wikipidedia lists of important artists within each of the five genres; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dance-pop_artists">Pop</a>, 
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hip_hop_musicians">Hiphop</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_R%26B_musicians">RnB</a>,
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_alternative_rock_artists">Rock</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_music_performers">Country</a>.
The data has been downloaded by reading the list of artists for each genre using the wikipedia API. The result of the API is a html file containing the list of artists 
of the given genre. By using regular expression on the html files it is possible to extract and save the name of each artist into a pandas DataFrame. Hence this process
results in a dataframe containing the list of all artists with the attributes <i>name, genre, name_ and link_name</i>. 
Then it is possible to use the same wikipedia API to download the wikipedia page of every artist. 
The downloaded wikipedia pages is then saved as .txt files with the link_name of then given artist. 
<p>

<p>
After the retrieval of the wikipedia pages different attributes can be collected from the .txt files, e.g. information about origin, latitude, longitude and years_active. 
Furthermore the number of followers can be retrived by using the genius API. The final dataset ready for basic statistics and network analysis consists of the following attributes.  
<p>
   
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="10%" />
<col width="10%" />
<col width="80%" />

<thead>
<tr class="header">

<tr>
    <td>name</td> 
    <td>str</td> 
    <td>Name of the artist as written in the wikipedia list</td>
</tr>
    <td>link_name</td> 
    <td>str</td> 
    <td>This attribute takes the same value as the name attribute, with the exception of links that are redirected. When running the wikipedia API some of the
      the values in the name attributes redirects to a wikipedia page with a different name. Furthermore all spaces are replaced with underscore </td>
</tr>
    <td>genre</td> 
    <td>str</td> 
    <td>The genre that the artist belongs to. It is possible for an artist to be in multiple genres. In such cases this attribute will take on multiple values that are separated by commas</td>
</tr>
    <td>origin</td> 
    <td>str</td> 
    <td>The origin of the artist</td>
</tr>
    <td>lat</td> 
    <td>float</td> 
    <td>The latitude of the origin</td>

      <td>lon</td> 
    <td>float</td> 
    <td>The longitude of the origin</td>
</tr>
      <td>start_year</td> 
    <td>str</td> 
    <td>The starting year of an artists carreer</td>
</tr>
   <td>end_year</td> 
    <td>str</td> 
    <td>The ending year of an artists carreer. The attribute will be equal to 'Present' if an artist is still active</td>
</tr>
</tr>
   <td>genius_id</td> 
    <td>str</td> 
    <td>The artists id on Genius</td>
</tr>
   <td>followers_count</td> 
    <td>str</td> 
    <td>The number of followers that an artist have on Genius</td>

<h3>Size of the dataset</h3>
<p>
The dataset has 6256 entries, hence it contains information about <b>6256 artists</b> distributed across the five genres. 
<p>
The size of the dataset is <b>1.079.396 byte large</b>. 
<p>
   
<h3>Validation of data source, Wikipedia</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not_a_reliable_source">Wikipedia is not a realiable source</a>, as it is a user-generated source.
   That is what Wikipedia writes about its own reliability. In this project 6256 wikipedia pages have been downloaded from the artist lists. 
   There is a probability that these lists might not be exhaustive, but it is assumed that they represent an adequate part of all artists in the genres. 
   Furthermore the information retrieved from the pages should not be trusted blindly, but instead be viewed at with a bit of caution. 
   Nonetheless it is assumed that Wikipedia is a sufficient data source for this study.

<h2>Basic Statistics</h2>
In the following sections some basic statistics are presented in order to gain knowledge and understanding of the data. As the topic of this study is about 
artists and their relation across different genres it is of high relevance to look at the genre distribution, active artists over time and..

<p>
<h3>Active artists over time</h3>
<p align="center">
{% include Active_artists.html %}
</p>
In the above plot there is a tab showing a plot of the number of active artists over time across all genres. This plot shows a large increase in the amount of artists
in the years around 1980 to 2010. In the second tab there is a plot of the active artists over time divided into the different genres. Based on this plot 
it can be concluded that HipHop is the largest genre, while Pop is the smallest genre.
Futhermore it can be seen how HipHop has a rather rapid increase compared to all other genres.
