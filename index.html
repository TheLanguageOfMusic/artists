 While every country has it's own language, there is only one language we can all understand. The Language of Music.

<b> Motivation and goal </b>

<p>
 
</p>


<p>
Music is an important part of the everyday life. It is almost inevitable to come across music in a regular every day.
Whether it is music on the radio, TV, at a party, in the bus or just pure background noice from different sources. 
Music undeniable affects our life. And it is important.

<ul style="list-style: none;">
 <li>It brings us together</li>
 <li>It can improve health and wellbeing</li>
 <li>It can improves confidence and resilience</li>
 <li>It is a creative outlet
</ul>
</p>
(At least according to this <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/teach/bring-the-noise/five-reasons-why-music-is-important/zv3krj6">article</a>.)

Music all comes down to the artists. If there are no artists, there are no songs to listen to. How does the artists links to one another and what kind of 
information can be derived from the different groupings? We know of a lot of icons that for a long time have dominated the hitlists. 
How are these represented in the data?

<p>
Music affects us in some way or another. But which words are we actually hearing when we put on our headphones? What kind of messages are we exposing ourselves to?
Are they in general negative or positive? How is the mood in the songs that we most often choose to listen to? 
We know of countless of love songs. Are these represented in the data? Or what other topics dominate the data?
</p>

<p>
  
</p>
<p>
These are questions that this study seeks to answer. We wish to investigate different artist and compare different genres to achive deeper insight
in the music industri. Prior to starting the study the scope of the project should be limited. There are quite frankly too many artists across the
world for this study to take them all into account with the limited computer power that we possess. 
Hence in order to make it manageble this study will focus on the following five music genres.
</p>
 
<p style="text-align:center;color:orange;font-size:20px" >
 Pop &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Hiphop  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  RnB  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Rock   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Country
</p>

<p>
We believe that we can uncover quite a lot of hidden secrets within the branch of music by the use of network analysis, sentiment analysis and topic modelling.
</p>

<h1>Dataset </h1>
<p>
 The date for the study is based on the wikipedia lists of important artists within each genre to limit the scope of artists in the network. 
   The wikipedia lists can be found here for each genre, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dance-pop_artists">Pop</a>, 
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hip_hop_musicians">Hiphop</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_R%26B_musicians">RnB</a>,
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_alternative_rock_artists">Rock</a>, <a href="hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_alternative_country_musicians">Country</a>.
</p>
   <p>
     For the network analysis each artist will be represented as a node, whereas the edges between the nodes represents wheather an artists page links to another artist. 
      That way the whole network will illustrates which artist are connected to other artists based on their wikipages. 
      The amount of links between two artist is the weight of the edges which is used later on in the network analysis. Furthermore five attributes are added to each
      node: genre, origin, start year and end year.
 </p>

   <p>
   For the sentiment analysis and topic modelling we use the genius API to extract songs. 
      To represent the genres we extract the most polular song from the most polular artists within each genre.
 Due to our limits of computer power the dataset contains 50 songs/artists from each genre leading to a total datasize of 250 songs.  </p>

            This study is based on a sample of the whole music industri and the results provides an indication of patterns within the whole industri.
