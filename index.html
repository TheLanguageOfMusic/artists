<h1> What is this page about? </h1>

<p> This project investigates the relationship and specific traits found in the music industri. 
The project fucos on the artists that wikipedia finds to be the most important once for each of the three genres R&B, PoP and Hip Hop. 
   These genres will then be compared thoughout the project. </p>

<h1> Motivation and goal </h1>

<p>
Music is an important part of the everyday life for most people. Whether it be music for a party, 
for the bus or the inescapable noice you hear in a telephone queue, it affects us in some way or another. 
But which words are we actually hearing when we put on our headphones? Are we exposing ourselves to positive or negative messages? 
   Are we subconsciously choosing to listen to negative songs or postitive? And lastly how does the artists connect to one another, 
   and what information can we derive from the different groupings? 
</p>

<p>
These are the questions we seek to answer in this study and to do just that we need some data. 
   But to get these data, we first need to limit our search. There are quite frankly too many artists across the world for us to take 
   them all into account with the limited computer power that we possess, so in order to make it manageble we chose to focus on five genre of music.

<p>
we believe that we can uncover quite a lot of hidden secrets within the branch of music, as well as proving/disproving wether 
   some genre of music is more violent/negative than others.

<h1>Dataset </h1>
<p>
  We are using the wikipedia list of important artists within each genre to limit the scope of artists in the network. 
 After that we are using the genius API to extract the necesary data and link the artists based on the collaborations they've had on songs. 
 We're using the amount of collaboration between two artists as the weight of the link, and we are adding five attributes to each node: 
 Popularity, followers, twitter-handle, subgenre and instagram-name.
