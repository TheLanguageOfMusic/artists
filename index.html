<b> Motivation and goal </b>

<p>

</p>


<p>
Music is an important part of the everyday life for most people. Whether it is music for a party, 
for the bus or the inescapable noice you hear in a telephone queue, it affects us in some way or another. 
But which words are we actually hearing when we put on our headphones? Are we exposing ourselves to positive or negative messages? 
   Are we subconsciously choosing to listen to negative songs, postitive song or specific topics? And lastly how does the artists connect to one another, 
   and what information can we derive from the different groupings? 
</p>

<p>
These are the questions we seek to answer in this study. We want to investigate different artist and compare different genres to achive deeper insight in the music industri. 
   Before starting the study we need to limit our project. There are quite frankly too many artists across the world for us to take 
   them all into account with the limited computer power that we possess, so in order to make it manageble we chose to focus on five music genres.
</p>


<p style="text-align:center;color:orange;font-size:20px" >
 Pop &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Hiphop  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  RnB  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Rock   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Country
</p>

<p>
We believe that we can uncover quite a lot of hidden secrets within the branch of music by the use of network analysis, sentiment analysis and topic modelling.
</p>

<h1>Dataset </h1>
<p>
 The date for the study is based on the wikipedia lists of important artists within each genre to limit the scope of artists in the network. 
   The lists can be found here for each genre, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dance-pop_artists">Pop</a>, 
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hip_hop_musicians">Hiphop</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_R%26B_musicians">RnB</a>,
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_alternative_rock_artists">Rock</a>, <a href="hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_alternative_country_musicians">Country</a>.
</p>
   <p>
     For the network analysis each artist will be represented as a node, whereas the edges between the nodes represents wheather an artists page links to another artist. 
      That way the whole network will illustrates which artist are connected to other artists based on their wikipages. 
      The amount of links between two artist is the weight of the edges which is used later on in the network analysis. Furthermore five attributes are added to each
      node: genre, origin, start year and end year.
 </p>

   <p>
   For the sentiment analysis and topic modelling we use the genius API to extract songs. For each of the top 50 connected artist within each genre 
      we retrieve their most popular song leading to a dataset of 250 songs. A even distrubution between the genres makes it possible to compare the genre for the analysis.
