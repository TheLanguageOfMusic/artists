<h2>Network analysis goal</h2>

<p>
 The network analysis provided on this page seeks to answer some questions about the linkage of music artists in and between different genres. Firstly, what 
 main characteristics that exists for the network - including what attributes that can help to describe the artists. Then we explore what the so called "Backbone"
 of the network looks like is, and how a backbone-analysis will change the network. In the end communities are created in an attempt to figure out, how well the 
 network actually represents common assumptions of linkages between music artists.
</p>


<h2>The network</h2>
<p>
 On the <a href="https://thelanguageofmusic.github.io/artists/Data.html">Data Description</a> page, it is explained in detail, how Wikipedia pages and Genius is used to collect information on each of the artists in the 
 genres: Pop, Hip Hop, RnB, Rock & Country. Below we see the first iteration of the network built. Here the Giant Connected Component (GCC) has been extracted to focus 
 on the most interconnected artists. This is shown in the network visualization below. The network consists of almost 6000 nodes and more than 68000 links. 
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="image/big_net.png" width=100%>

<p>
 Due to the large number of nodes and links, it is close to impossible to the specific connections in the network. However, it is remarkable, that there is clear 
 separation between the different genres. The top left part of the network is dominated by Hip Hop artists. The red and blue nodes, representing Rock and Country 
 artists respectively, are equally isolated in different parts of the network graph. The RnB artists are located very close to the Hip Hop artist, which makes 
 sense when relating it to the common conception about the similarities in these genres. Also, it has been discovered for the yellow nodes – namely, the artists 
 contained in multiple genres – that most of these artists are exactly in both the Hip Hop and RnB categories. When it comes to the Pop artists, their position in 
 the middle of the network graph also conceptually matches with the fact, that many Pop artists will use elements from different genres to be “popular” for everyone.
 
 <br><br>
 
 Next we look into the degree distribution of the network. In the figure below this is shown for each of the genres. If you want to compare the genres separately, 
 then click their respective name in the legend on the left. Also, keep in mind the total number of artists in each genre shown on the <a href="https://thelanguageofmusic.github.io/artists/Data.html">Data</a> page when 
 looking at the scale-difference here.
</p>

 {% include deg.html %}

<p>
 The degree distribution of the genres seems most reminiscent of a power-law distribution, but the genres Hip Hop and Rock could also be fitted with a Poisson 
 distribution. It is also noticeable that there clearly are a few artists in each category with a lot more links than the rest of the artists. To inspect these 
 a bit more, the 15 most connected artists are shown in the table below. As it happens these names coincide with some of the most popular artists of all time.
</p>

 {% include table_deg.html %}


<p>
 Even though there are clear more nodes with few connections than many, the average degree of the network is above 19. This, together with the fact that the 
 network is visually very difficult to inspect, have led to a Backbone Analysis of the network.
</p>

 

<h2>Backbone of the network</h2>

<p>
 In order to conduct the backbone analysis, the links of the network should be weighted in a way that represents the importance of the indivial links. For this 
 analysis the weight of a link is chose to be equal to the number of times it is included on the wiki pages - in both directions. This means that if node 
 <i>i</i> mentions node <i>j</i> two times, and node <i>j</i> mentions node <i>i</i> once, then the resulting weight of the link will be 3. This leads to the conclusion, that the 
 network must be undirected for this weighting to be possible.
 
 <br><br>
 
 The method for extracting the backbone can then be carried out according to the presented technique in 
 <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/106/16/6483.full.pdf">this article</a> from 2009 by M. A. Serrano et al. The purpose of the method is find a significans 
 level <i>&#945;</i> for which a sufficient amount of link-weight is kept in the network, while the total number of edges is greatly reduced.
 In order to select suitable significans level <i>&#945;</i> we look at the figure below. On the left we se <i>N<sub>B</sub>/N<sub>T</sub></i> 
 as a function of <i>W<sub>B</sub>/W<sub>T</sub></i> at different significance levels, where <i>N</i> is nodes and <i>W</i> is weight and the subscripts <i>B</i> and <i>T</i> refers to the backbone and total network repectively. 
 To the right we se <i>N<sub>B</sub>/N<sub>T</sub></i> against the number of edges <i>E</i> kept at different significans levels.
</p>

{% include alpha_vals.html %}

<p>
  It is obviously a bit subjective which significans level that should be chosen

 Hejhej

<h2>Commuities</h2>
<p>
Now that the network have been reduced greatly in both nodes and links, it will be easier to evaluate the communities in the network. As mentioned we want to look 
 into, how well the network that the  BLA BLA BLA.. noget om hvordan der findes comunitites (den der algo). + noget om hvilke communities der findes aka se nedenfor.
</p>

{% include com_size.html %}

<p>
 Mere om hvilke communities der ses ovenfor og hvordan de er fordelt ud på genre. Husk at nævne (igen) at der er færre i nogle genre end andre.
 + hertil viser vi plottet nedenfor bla bla. ihhh hvor er det fint. eksempler på ting der giver super mening
