<h2>Sentiment analysis goal</h2>
<p>
The purpose of sentiment analysis in our study is to get insight into the emotional part of the songs. We start by looking at the overall picture and investigate 
  the distribution of sentiment, revealing wheather the top listen songs provides a positive or negative message. To get a deeper insight we investigate the sentiment
  for each genre to see if some genre is more violent/negative than others. Furthermore the study will include an evaluation of the models performance of classifying the sentiment of the songs. 
  In the end we look into the most positive and negative songs and what words discribes the sentiment groups 
  to understand what makes a song negative/positive. Hopefully this part of our study will provide knowledge of the emotional state of songs and how the genres differents on their sentiment.
So that you in the future can chose you playlist depending on your mood.</p>





<h2>Sentiment tool</h2>
<p>
  A sentiment analysis model is a machine learning technique that can classify a text as positive, neutral or negative. 
  Analysing language is called Natural Language Processing(NLP) and contains both sentiment analysis and topic modeling which we will cover in this study.
  For the sentiment analysis the goal is that the model should understand all kind of underlying tones in a text. This includes negation, capitalization, linguistic, context, symboles
    and sarcasm and takes these into accounting when classifying the sentiment. An example of a negation that the sentiment model should be able to capture
  can be seen in the sentence,  <i>”I do not like you”</i>. The word like is normally classified as positive, but due to the linguistic structure the words in front of <i>like</i> namely
  <i>"I do not"</i> yields negation of <i>like</i>, making the sentence negative.
 </p>

<p>
There exist many sentiment analysis models, all for different purpose and each with their stregnth and weaknesses. Due to the often extream word used in songs
  the choosen model is Vader. Vader(Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), is trained on social media data and is therefore caperble of understanding
  intensity (”!!!”), acronyms (”LOL”) and slang. The model classifies based on full sentence structure since it relies on wordorder.
   The Vader sentiment model calculates a sentiment score(compound score) on the scale [−1;1] and then sets a
  threshold to classify the text as positive, neutral or negative. See <a href="https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment">The Vader Sentiment Model</a> github page for detailed describtion of the model. 
  For this study we use the Vader sentiment classification which are as followed:</p>
  
<p style="text-align:center;">
  positive: sentiment score >=0.5 <br>
  neutral: -0.5 < sentiment score < 0.5 <br>
  negative: sentiment score =<-0.5 <br>
  </p>    



<h2>Sentiment distribution</h2>

<p>
It is interesting to investigate the overall sentiment of the music industry to obtain an overall picture of wheather people like to listen to happy or sad songs. 
 The Vader sentiment analysis has been performed on the data and the distribution of the classes can be seen below.
  
</p>


{% include sentimentdist.html %}




    



<p>
There are very few songs classified as neutral this indicates that music tent to have an extreame polarised sentiment. Wheather it is very loving or extream angry.
This gives an indication that music tries to avoke emotion within the listener. Furthermore the overall picture indicates that there are mostly postive songs. 
  </p>

<p>
  It should be noted that the dataset does not contain the whole music industry and that the results gives a picture of what the industry looks like.
</p>


<h2>Sentiment distribution pr genre</h2>

<p>
To achieve a deeper understanding af the sentiment distribution we have chosen to look at each genre at a time. 
  This wsy, we can compare the genres. and their senntiment to understand how the genres differences. 
  The resulting classification of songs within each genre can be seen below. 
  
  


</p>
{% include sentimentgenre.html %}




<p>
It is clear to see that some genre tent to have more negative songs where others more positive. As expected hiphop(followed by rock) is the genre with the largest amount of negative songs.
  Whereas RnB and pop is the genres with the most positive messages. There is a clear indication that depending on the genre we chose to listen to the tone we are exposed to is dependen thereon. 
</p>

<h2>Model evaluation</h2>
<p>
To evaluate the model performace we look into the most positive and most negative songs. By reading the lyrics we can evaluate if these songs has been classified correctly and thereby get an indication of the models overall performance.
  If you want to see another evaluation of the model check out <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/121j5cVK8jS9F-RIRD84YaGZYDMvBw0IM?usp=sharing">The Explainer Notebook</a>
  where we evaluate the models performance based on random samples of the data across sentiment classes. 
  The results from that evaluation shows the same as the following evaluation, namely that the Vader Sentiment Model success in classifying the songs correctly.

We have chosen to look further into the lyrics of these songs to evaluate if they really do provide positive messages. 
</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <b> Girls Like you</b>
<p>This song is about a boy being madly in love with a girl. As the lyrics says, spending 24 hours together is not even enough for him. There are no doubt that this song has been classified correctly as extreamly positive.

<b>Mirrors</b>
<p>
The song was inspired by Justin's grandparents’ relationship of 63 years. It is about finding true love and your other half.
  As he sings, "You reflect me, I love that about you. And if I could, I would look at us all the time". 
  The lyrics includes many positive sentences with love and disire and it is therefore classified correctly.

    <b> Thank u, next</b>
<p>
  At a first glance of the title "Thank you, next" is kind of ironic and not positive but if you look closer at the lyrics you discover why the sentiment analysis has classified this song as extreamly positive. 
  The song is about learning to love your self as she sings "I've got so much love... I turned out amazing" which illustrates a correct classification after all.

<p>
 
</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <b> HUMBLE</b>
<p> This song is about the conflicting feelings of success. 
  Throughout the song the lyrcis encouragee powerfull people to be humble and become more down to earth. He sings, 
  “I’m so fuckin’ sick and tired of the photoshop. Show me somethin’ natural like ass with some stretch marks". The song disses the upper class lifestyle and the song is thereby correctly classified as negative.

<p>
  To summarize the evaluation of the model it can be stated that the performane of the Vader Sentiment Model is very accurate when it comes to classifying songs as positive or negative.
</p>


<h2>Wordclouds pr sentiment</h2>
<p>
We want to further investigate what makes a song negative or positive and if some specific words indicates and describes the emotional tone of a song. To do so we look at the wordclouds for each sentiment class. 
  The wordclouds is created based on the top tf-idf words from songs within each sentiment group hence the wordclouds contains the most distincitive words for each sentiment.
</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="image/pos.png" width="530" height="300">                                      
 </p>  
    <p>
 It makes perfectly sence that words like <i>"love"</i>, <i>"baby"</i>, <i>"heart"</i> and <i>"thank"</i> is a part of the positive wordcloud. This is word that we normally assosiate with a positive message. 
                                                                                                     
 </p>                                   
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="image/neu.png" width="530" height="300">
 </p>  
    <p>
As expected the wordcloud for the neutral sentiment class contains words in oppisite emotional directions and quite a lot of words with no sentiment orintations.
 </p>                                           

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="image/neg.png" width="530" height="300">
 </p>   
 <p>
Finally the wordcloud for the negative sentiment contains words like <i>"fuck"</i>, <i>"bitch"</i> and <i>"shit"</i> which clearly indicate a negative message.
   Furthermore the wordcloud contains the word <i>"nigga"</i> which is not a negative word but a word many hihop artist uses in their songs. The hiphoppers songs has often a
                                                          negative message causing their lyrics to be a part of the negative wordclouds ansd thereby also the word <i>"nigga"</i>.
 </p>
                                           
 <h2>Sentiment conclusion</h2>
 <p>
 This study has extraced meaningful insights into the sentiment and tone of the songs we listen to. The results clearly proves that some genres tent to 
 have more negative messages,  which we can take with us when we chose our playlist. Furthermore the analysis showed us that most of the top listen songs actually 
 provides us with happy and positive feelings. In the end the study also showed which words represent positivity and negativity in songs. 
 </p>
 
 <p>
 For further investigation of the sentiment within the music industry we recommend a larger dataset with extra genres to provide a more versatile perspective.
 In addition it would be interesting to chose another sentiment analysis tool to compare the models and their results or even train a new model on songs to achieve an even better sentiment model for the research area.
