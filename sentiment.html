<h2>Sentiment analysis goal</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this study is to get insight into the emotional part of the songs we choose. We start by looking at the overall picture and investigate 
  the distribution of sentiment, revialing wheather the top listen songs provides a positive or negative message. To get a deeper insight we investigate the sentiment
  for each genre to see if some genre is more violent/negative than others. In the end we look into the most positive and negative songs and what words discribes the sentiment groups. 
</p>



<h2>Sentiment tools</h2>
<p>
Sentiment analysis is a machine learning technique capable of understanding the tone that underlie a 
  text and thus classify the spoken human language as positive, neutral or negative.  When analysing language data, a model should ideally takelinguistics, 
  word ambiguity, negation, capitalization, emojis, context, symbolism and sarcasminto account to capture meaningful microsignals within language patterns 
  and subsequentlydetermine the relative positivity or negativity of written text. An example of how the sentiment analysis should be able to capture 
  negations can be seen in the sentence ”I do not like you”, the word like is treated as a positive verb however,
  due to the linguistic structure, the proceeding phrase ”I do not” yields negation of like, hence a negative sentence polarity.

<p>
There exist multiple sentiment analysis models, all for different purpis and each with their stregnth and weaknesses. Due to the often extream word used in lyrics
  the choosen model is Vader. Vader(Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), is trained on social media data and is thus naturally attuned to sentiments 
  expressed in this context, including both polarity, intensity (”!!!”), emoticons (”:-/”), acronyms (”LOL”) and slang.  The model relies on word-order sensitive 
  relationship, i.e. classifying based on full sentence structure. The Vader sentiment model calculates and returns the probability of a given input sentence to be 
  positive, negative, and neutral. For example:“The song is great!”gives the score: positive= 0.9, neutral = 0.1 and negative = 0.  
  These three probabilities will always add up to 1. Furthermore the Vader sentiment calculates a compound score which is an aggregated normalizedscore with −1 being 
  the most negative and +1 the most positive. To classify a song as positive, neutral or negative the Vader sentiment model provides a threshold on the compound score
  see xxx for detailed describtion of the Vader model. The diviation of the class is as followed:</p>
  
<p style="text-align:center;">
  positive: compound >=0.5 <br>
  neutral: -0.5 < compound < 0.5 <br>
  negative: compound=<-0.5 <br>
  </p>

  The classification of the sentiment can be seen below.

<h2>Sentiment distribution</h2>

<p>
It is interesting to investigate the overall sentiment for top listen songs. This gives an overall picture whether people like to listen to happy or sad songs. 
 Based on the thresholds for the sentiment score each song is classified as negative, neutral or positve. The distribution of the classes can be seen below.

<p>
There are very few songs classified as neutral this indicates that music tent to have an extreame polariasied sentiment. Wheather it is very loving or extream angry.
This gives an indication that music tries to avoke emotion within the listener. Furthermore the overall picture indicates that there are most postive songs. 
  To further investigate this a sentiment analysis for each genre has ben made below to see if what kind of genre we chose to listen to has a specific sentiment indicator.

<h2>Sentiment distribution pr genre</h2>

For a compareson between the genres a sentiment analysis for each genre has been caried out. The resulting classification of songs within each genre can be seen below.
