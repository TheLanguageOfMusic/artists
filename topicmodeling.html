<h2>Topic Modelling goal</h2>
<p>
The topic modelling part of this study aim to investigate what lyrics we actually listen to and fills our minds with when we play our favourite song. 
  We want to research if some topics are more popular than others and if the topics depend on the genre. 
Our study begins by looking at the most frequence words and see if some patterns can be drawn. Frome there we continue investigating the topics by
  cleaning the text and reducing the vocabulary size. The topic modelling is done on the cleaned data to reveal topics within the songs. 
  In order to get an even deeper insight into the music industri we investigate each genre at a time to see if they have their own individual topics. 
  The goal is to understand the words we listen to and to discover if the topics and messages from the lyrics depends on our choice of genre.

<h2>Topic Modelling tool</h2>

<p>
 The study will use Latent DirichletAllocation (LDA) to perform topic modeling on the data.  
  The LDA model consists of two main procedures; generating topics and assigning topics to each text. 
  Each text will then be described by a distribution of topics and each topic can in turn be described by a distribution of words.
  
  A necessary step for all topic models is to reduce corpus dimensionality, i.e. the total number of unique words, as much as possible prior to model implementation.
  The main reason being that unnecessary words adds too much noise when finding meaningful patterns.

<h2>Frequency count befor cleaning</h2>
<p>
As a priliminary investigation of the lyrics we look at the most frequence words within all songs to investigate if some topics is revealed. <br>
... <br>

A few meaningsful words appears such as love and xxx, but most of the frequenced words are stopwords without meaning. A more thorough text cleaning is 
needed before topic modeling.</p>
